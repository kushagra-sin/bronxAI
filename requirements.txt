# Use tensorflow-cpu for smaller footprint if not using GPU,
# or tflite-runtime if available.
# For simplicity and guaranteed interpreter access, stick with full TensorFlow
# or tensorflow-cpu which includes the TFLite interpreter.
tensorflow==2.20.0
# Alternatively, if you want a truly minimal runtime (might be harder to install on Render):
tflite-runtime==2.20.0 # <--- Use this IF you can get it to install. Otherwise, use tensorflow.
